        <h1>The Magic of Feel</h1>
        </header>
        <p> When Apple released the 2008-era macbook in black, I wanted one <em>bad</em>.  I remember feeling embarassed because the black one cost $100 extra.  How could I squander my hard-earned money on black plastic?  I ended up ignoring my guilt.  I consoled myself because the black one had a larger hard-drive.    
        </p>
        
        <p>I've returned to the experience many times, wondering about it.  A few years ago I overheard two technical guys conversing about Asus tablets vs. iPads.  In their mind, the clear winner was Asus, on the basis of processing power per dollar.  I remember feeling that the substance of their discussion was sound, in a way, but that it missed the point.  It's particularly interesting that one of the two was exultant in his superior logic, as if he thought Apple consumers were blind.</p>
        
        <p>It is clear to me that the Asus-loving technical guy was, in fact, the blind one.  But what did he miss?  Why pay more for a tablet with less processing power?  The same reason I bought the black macbook: feel.</p>
        

        <h2 class="donthyphenate" id="docx2md2indd">From Word over Markdown to
        InDesign</h2>
        
        <p>When last year we designed the grids, styles and templates for
        <em>Maja</em>, the publisher had in mind a print edition only. During
        production, our workflow would not be any different from what we
        mastered from our long time experience with print design best
        practices. Yet, as we gradually shift from print to digital design, we
        find ourselves introducing web development tools and best practices
        into the print production workflow all the more often. As the
        production flows for both output media, screen and paper, coincide and
        increasingly share a common source base, <strong>automated cross-media
        publishing starts to become both a reality and a swift experience, with
        very little extra overhead.</strong> Simultaneously going online as the
        printed issues roll off the presses, is a business opportunity we now
        can happily offer to all our print clients.</p>
        
        <p>In a <a href="http://rhythmus.be/md2indd">previous article</a> I
        discussed at length how we set up a print production workflow based on
        the <strong>automated conversion of MS Word documents</strong> supplied
        by the client, <strong>to linked InDesign templates</strong>, using the
        Markdown format as an intermediary “master” copy of the client’s
        content. In this article, we go more into the workflow for producing
        the online edition. However, as mentioned already, both editions are
        generated from the same single repository of Markdown source files.</p>

        <p>Markdown is a relatively new document format, a <em>lightweight</em>
        markup language with an easy to learn syntax (compared to for example
        html or xml). If you’re not familiar with Markdown already, then I
        definitely recommend reading our <a href=
        "http://rhythmus.be/md2indd">previous article</a> and have a look at
        the tutorials we there refer to.</p>
        
        <p>Yet another benefit of using the Markdown document format for the
        source content, is that Markdown is a robust and widely supported new
        Web standard, so that going from print to a companion online edition,
        has become a relatively small extra step to take.</p>
        

        <h2 class="donthyphenate" id="print-to-Web">From print to the Web</h2>
        
        <p>Sooner or later, I reckoned, <em>Maja</em>’s publisher would indeed
        want to have the magazine’s content available to online readers too, in
        an appropriate electronic format.</p>
        <p>At their request, last time the printer’s prepress department
        wrapped our weighty 155 MB, print-optimized, ready-for-press Uncoated
        FOGRA29 (ISO 12647-2:2004) PDF in some Flash-based website
        widget.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
        Obviously, it’s not been the flawless experience they hoped for: an
        obsolete technology which renders it all useless on mobile devices and
        sluggish everywhere else, a cluttered user interface with an irrelevant
        propensity for skeuomorphic kitsch, like simulacra of flipping pages,
        drop shadows and fake gloss — nota bene for an edition on uncoated
        paper! — complete with a toe-curling sythesized audio sample of paper
        being shredded, rather than the gentle sound of leaves reversed.</p>
        <p>In short: <strong>wrapping a pdf optimized for print</strong> into
        some gimmicky plugin, naturally yields an <strong>unresponsive</strong>
        and everything but pleasant <strong>user experience on the
        Web</strong>.⁠<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id=
        "fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

        <p>So, this time around the publisher asked whether we had no better
        solution, and if, for example, we could deliver the print layouts along
        with the formatted articles “in php format”, so that they might
        “import” them into their existing WordPress site… Try to explain that
        php is a server scripting language, not a document format, let alone a
        design standard. And then attempt to explain all those many other
        difficult issues that come with making user-friendly webpages. Well,
        never mind— But we did have a solution, and one which would perfectly
        fit their needs at that.</p>
        
        <p>Indeed, the automated publishing software we had been building
        in-house, matured enough already to give it a try. Thus, when
        <em>Maja</em>’s publisher asked about getting “php versions”, I felt
        confident enough to put our prototype-in-progress to the test, and use
        it in production. For their use case, quite some interventions were
        needed still: for assisting the automated document and file
        conversions, for creating custom templates and styles, for the branded
        deployment on the server using the client’s domain. Step by step,
        however, we’re scaling these still manual tweaks into a fully automated
        build process, too. Much of what we’re describing in this article
        already is available as standard features.</p>
       
        <p>From the folder tree, we create a provisory hierarchical structure
        for the publication, which can then be further edited in an
        <code>index</code> file, which allows the editor to exclude, hide and
        re-arrange the articles and sections (nodes on the tree) in any desired
        order. The resulting outline reflects how the editor believes the
        contents of the publication will be presented best to the readers, as a
        both thematically organized and sequentially ordered whole. In fact,
        this editorial model also functions as a “configuration file”, from
        which the entire publication will be built <em>and</em> from which both
        the visible table-of-contents and interactive, navigational menus are
        generated, fully automatically.</p>
