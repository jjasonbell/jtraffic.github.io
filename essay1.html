        <h1>The Magic of Feel</h1>
        </header>
        <p>Last month we released a brand-new online journal: <a href=
        "http://maja.jongeacademie.be/2"><em>Maja</em>, “Magazine van de Jonge
        Academie”</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id=
        "fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>Maja</em>’s first issue appeared last
        year as a print-only publication. As of issue #2, <em>Maja</em> now is
        available both in <strong>print</strong>, and as a digital publication
        on the <strong>Web</strong>, with a <strong>responsive design</strong>
        fit for all (modern) devices and browsers.</p>
        <p><em>Maja</em>’s digital edition still is an experiment, but one
        which proves that print and online may fraternally co-exist, cater to
        different audiences and/or several usage scenario’s, and can both offer
        complementary features. Publishers know that today’s <strong>readers
        increasingly consume written content on their smartphones</strong>
        (during commute, for example), <strong>while mostly still preferring to
        read on paper</strong> (back at home, relaxing on the couch). In this
        article we discuss the advantages of a <strong>shared production
        workflow for both print and online editions</strong>, by example of
        <em>Maja</em>’s case. Both editions were semi-automatically generated
        from the same source of input documents, with software we are
        developing in-house.</p>
        <h2 class="donthyphenate" id="app">Building an app for easy cross‑media
        publishing</h2>
        <p>In August, we started work on a side-project which, by now, has
        grown into an almost full-time enterprise. We’re actively developing an
        application which tightly integrates<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2"
        id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> our typesetting and book crafting
        expertise, our print production and web development know-how, into a
        modular tool suite for publishers, editors and authors (both the
        professional writer and the occasional blogger). One and another must
        culminate into a forward thinking cross-media publishing web service.
        The ultimate goal of our value proposition is quite
        straightforward:</p>

        </ol>
        <p>We want to make it easy for anyone to publish to the Web, without
        people needing to go through the baffling and sore procedures of server
        setup and database configuration, security and load balancing sysadmin,
        file conversion, metadata extraction, templating and styling,
        performance optimization, search engine hacking, and so one. <strong>We
        believe writers and publishers should be able to focus on content and
        reaching readers, and not on the technicalities of delivery.</strong>
        Writing and uploading artwork, should suffice to create a beautiful,
        modern, professional, multi-media publication, out-of-the-box — with a
        single click indeed.</p>
        <p>Our integrated production workflow enables simultaneous formatting,
        styling, and typesetting, of both paper and web editions. Development
        of our platform<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id=
        "fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> for easy, automated, cross-media publishing
        is steadily going forward, and <strong>we will soon be
        releasing</strong> the functionality of our software <strong>as a
        public web service</strong>. <em>Maja</em> is its first application and
        as a prototype proof-of-concept, it’s a success already, offering a
        preview on some of the core features of our upcoming service.</p>
        <h2 class="donthyphenate" id="docx2md2indd">From Word over Markdown to
        InDesign</h2>
        <p>When last year we designed the grids, styles and templates for
        <em>Maja</em>, the publisher had in mind a print edition only. During
        production, our workflow would not be any different from what we
        mastered from our long time experience with print design best
        practices. Yet, as we gradually shift from print to digital design, we
        find ourselves introducing web development tools and best practices
        into the print production workflow all the more often. As the
        production flows for both output media, screen and paper, coincide and
        increasingly share a common source base, <strong>automated cross-media
        publishing starts to become both a reality and a swift experience, with
        very little extra overhead.</strong> Simultaneously going online as the
        printed issues roll off the presses, is a business opportunity we now
        can happily offer to all our print clients.</p>
        <p>In a <a href="http://rhythmus.be/md2indd">previous article</a> I
        discussed at length how we set up a print production workflow based on
        the <strong>automated conversion of MS Word documents</strong> supplied
        by the client, <strong>to linked InDesign templates</strong>, using the
        Markdown format as an intermediary “master” copy of the client’s
        content. In this article, we go more into the workflow for producing
        the online edition. However, as mentioned already, both editions are
        generated from the same single repository of Markdown source files.</p>

        <p>Markdown is a relatively new document format, a <em>lightweight</em>
        markup language with an easy to learn syntax (compared to for example
        html or xml). If you’re not familiar with Markdown already, then I
        definitely recommend reading our <a href=
        "http://rhythmus.be/md2indd">previous article</a> and have a look at
        the tutorials we there refer to.</p>
        <p>Yet another benefit of using the Markdown document format for the
        source content, is that Markdown is a robust and widely supported new
        Web standard, so that going from print to a companion online edition,
        has become a relatively small extra step to take.</p>
        <h2 class="donthyphenate" id="print-to-Web">From print to the Web</h2>
        <p>Sooner or later, I reckoned, <em>Maja</em>’s publisher would indeed
        want to have the magazine’s content available to online readers too, in
        an appropriate electronic format.</p>
        <p>At their request, last time the printer’s prepress department
        wrapped our weighty 155 MB, print-optimized, ready-for-press Uncoated
        FOGRA29 (ISO 12647-2:2004) PDF in some Flash-based website
        widget.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
        Obviously, it’s not been the flawless experience they hoped for: an
        obsolete technology which renders it all useless on mobile devices and
        sluggish everywhere else, a cluttered user interface with an irrelevant
        propensity for skeuomorphic kitsch, like simulacra of flipping pages,
        drop shadows and fake gloss — nota bene for an edition on uncoated
        paper! — complete with a toe-curling sythesized audio sample of paper
        being shredded, rather than the gentle sound of leaves reversed.</p>
        <p>In short: <strong>wrapping a pdf optimized for print</strong> into
        some gimmicky plugin, naturally yields an <strong>unresponsive</strong>
        and everything but pleasant <strong>user experience on the
        Web</strong>.⁠<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id=
        "fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

        <p>So, this time around the publisher asked whether we had no better
        solution, and if, for example, we could deliver the print layouts along
        with the formatted articles “in php format”, so that they might
        “import” them into their existing WordPress site… Try to explain that
        php is a server scripting language, not a document format, let alone a
        design standard. And then attempt to explain all those many other
        difficult issues that come with making user-friendly webpages. Well,
        never mind— But we did have a solution, and one which would perfectly
        fit their needs at that.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the automated publishing software we had been building
        in-house, matured enough already to give it a try. Thus, when
        <em>Maja</em>’s publisher asked about getting “php versions”, I felt
        confident enough to put our prototype-in-progress to the test, and use
        it in production. For their use case, quite some interventions were
        needed still: for assisting the automated document and file
        conversions, for creating custom templates and styles, for the branded
        deployment on the server using the client’s domain. Step by step,
        however, we’re scaling these still manual tweaks into a fully automated
        build process, too. Much of what we’re describing in this article
        already is available as standard features.</p>
       
        <p>From the folder tree, we create a provisory hierarchical structure
        for the publication, which can then be further edited in an
        <code>index</code> file, which allows the editor to exclude, hide and
        re-arrange the articles and sections (nodes on the tree) in any desired
        order. The resulting outline reflects how the editor believes the
        contents of the publication will be presented best to the readers, as a
        both thematically organized and sequentially ordered whole. In fact,
        this editorial model also functions as a “configuration file”, from
        which the entire publication will be built <em>and</em> from which both
        the visible table-of-contents and interactive, navigational menus are
        generated, fully automatically.</p>
