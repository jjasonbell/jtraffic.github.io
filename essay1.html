        <h1>The Magic of Feel</h1>
        </header>
        <p> When Apple released the 2008-era macbook in black, I wanted one <em>bad</em>.  I remember feeling embarassed because the black one cost $100 extra.  How could I squander my hard-earned money on black plastic?  I ended up ignoring my guilt.  I consoled myself because the black one had a larger hard-drive.    
        </p>
        
        <p>I've returned to the experience many times, wondering about it.  A few years a professor for whom I was a TA needed help from our university IT department with a classroom polling system.  During some downtime, I overheard two of the IT guys conversing about Asus tablets vs. iPads.  In their mind, the clear winner was Asus, on the basis of processing power per dollar.  It's particularly interesting that one of the two was exultant in his superior logic, as if he thought Apple consumers were blind.</p>
        
        <p>It is clear to me that the Asus-loving technical guy was, in fact, the blind one.  Ironically, his variety of blindness was the likely reason our IT department had adopted polling technology with such a dismal user experience.  I believe his superiority came from his perception that he could overcome usage barriers that others could not.  Yet it seems backward to take pride in being able to use hard-to-use technology.  Wouldn't it be nice if the technology were easily usable to begin with?</p>

        <p>But let us return to the discussion of Asus vs. Apple.  Why <em>would</em> anyone pay more for a tablet with less processing power?  The same reason I bought the black macbook: feel.</p>
