        <h1>The Magic of Feel</h1>
                <h4>2017-1-11</h4>
        </header>
        <p> When Apple released the 2008-era macbook in black, I wanted one <em>bad</em>.  I remember feeling embarassed because the black one cost $100 extra.  How could I squander my hard-earned money on black plastic?  I ended up ignoring my guilt.  I consoled myself because the black one had a larger hard-drive.    
        </p>
        
        <p>I've returned to the experience many times, wondering about it.  A few years a professor for whom I was a TA needed help from our university IT department with a classroom polling system.  During some downtime, I overheard two of the IT guys conversing about Asus tablets vs. iPads.  In their mind, the clear winner was Asus, on the basis of processing power per dollar.  It's particularly interesting that one of the two was exultant in his superior logic, as if he thought Apple consumers were blind.</p>
        
        <p>It is clear to me that the Asus-loving technical guy was, in fact, the blind one.  Ironically, his variety of blindness was the likely reason our IT department had adopted polling technology with such a dismal user experience.  I believe his feeling of superiority came from his perception that he could overcome usage barriers that others could not.  Yet it seems backward to take pride in being able to use hard-to-use technology.  Wouldn't it be nice if the technology were easily usable to begin with?</p>

        <p>But let us return to the discussion of Asus vs. Apple.  Why <em>would</em> anyone pay more for a tablet with less processing power?  The same reason I bought the black macbook: feel.</p>
        

        <h2 class="donthyphenate">Looks Good &#8658; Feels Good </h2>
        
        <p> People perceive aesthetically appealing products as easier to use. This is not just a hunch, it’s fairly well-established. This is a specific example of a broader concept called a ‘halo effect.’ Halo effects refer to positive spillovers in perception. A good example: if someone famous posted the exact same article that I’m writing now, it would be judged as better than this by those who read it. The famous person has a celebrity halo that spills into a perception of writing quality.</p>

        <p>Looks spill into plenty more than usability, as well. <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w4518">A famous article</a> in <em>The American Economic Review</em> provides lots of evidence that looks even influence earning power.</p>  

        <p>Of course aesthetics have direct value of their own, without needing to spill into other variables, but the key in this context is that looks influence the way a product feels, and feel matters a lot.</p>

        <h2 class="donthyphenate">Tangible Intangibles</h2>
        
        <p>Some researchers did a study. They put people on treadmills and gave them Gatorade, except in one group the Gatorade label was missing. In their mind, those study participants were drinking some generic sports beverage. Guess what? The people with branded Gatorade ran longer.</p>

        <p> <a class="footnoteRef" href="https://www.ted.com/talks/rory_sutherland_life_lessons_from_an_ad_man">Rory Sutherland</a>> and I agree about placebos: they are awesome. The mere perception that something will work makes it work, and it works on almost every non-acute condition. The Gatorade study proves it can work in more than the conventional contexts as well.</p>

        <p>Feel is a powerful placebo.</p>

        <h2 class="donthyphenate">Feel is Durable</h2>
        <p>Lots of psychological research suggests that people are happier when they spend money on experiences versus things. This seems prescriptive, at first, until you realize that separating things and experiences is hard. I ride a longboard skateboard to school whenever I can. I see the longboard as a renewable experience, not a thing.</p>

        <p>Feel is a renewable experience. If a product feels slow or cheap, that comes through with every use. On the flip side, great products deliver good emotions with every use for a long time. I am almost always happy when I arrive at school having ridden there on a very high-quality longboard.</p>

        <h2 class="donthyphenate">What's so Good about it?</h2>
        <p>Great design can be ineffable. Now Apple has become much less exciting, but back in 2008, it retained its luster. When people wanted to know why I used a Mac and not a PC, I had a tough time explaining. After thinking about it for years, I still can’t offer many specifics. Basically, it just feels better.</p>

        <p>This leads to the crux of the idea: good feel is super valuable precisely because it’s been so difficult to engineer en masse. That may change, and in fact I hope it does, but in the meantime those designers who understand how to create it will command large rents.</p>

        <h2 class="donthyphenate">Design Power</h2>
        <p>The quants of the world should stop beating people up for caring about ‘soft factors’. If you think someone paid too much for good design, you might be right or you might have bad taste.</p>

        <p>Sometimes in the business world better design is all it takes. I suspect lots of good ideas fail because someone was thinking too much like my Asus-loving friend.</p>
